# Spam-DEI-Script
Script for spamming https://enddei.ed.gov


So this is for spamming the US gov's DEI tipline. Also, this is considered a federal crime so ~~don't do it~~ USE A VPN :3

Dependencies:

Python:
``` Bash
sudo apt install python3
```
Selenium:
``` Bash
pip install selenium
```

Also this goes without saying but don't get caught (UwU)

Also, credits to [u/The_Cool_Hierarchist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Cool_Hierarchist/) and [u/OctaazacubaneN8](https://www.reddit.com/user/OctaazacubaneN8/) (I shamelessly stole their comments from /transgendercirclejerk to serve as the description field.) Also yes, I'm aware that this readme is a mess.

Also don't forgot to change out the profile path variable (line 47) which can be found by navigating to about:profiles. DO NOT USE THE .CACHE ONE, USE THE ONE WITH THE SHORTER PATH.

Also also I suck at comments so I used AI to add the comments, so theyre probs a bit goofy TwT

Also Also Also (final one I swear) use the package caffeine to keep ur gnome open and running and to stop it locking whilst this script is running
